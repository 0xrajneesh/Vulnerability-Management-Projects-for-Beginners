# Project: Getting Started with Vulnerability Management using QualysGuard

## Introduction
In this project, students will be introduced to vulnerability management using QualysGuard, a leading cloud-based platform for vulnerability management and compliance. By the end of this project, students will be able to set up QualysGuard, perform vulnerability scans, and analyze scan reports.

## Pre-requisites
- Basic knowledge of network and system administration
- Familiarity with web-based interfaces
- A QualysGuard account (trial or educational license)

## Lab Set-up and Tools
- Access to QualysGuard platform
- A target machine for scanning (can be a local VM or a networked device)

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Setting up QualysGuard Account

**Steps:**

1. Sign up for a QualysGuard trial or educational license at the Qualys website.
2. Once registered, log in to the QualysGuard portal using the provided credentials.
3. Navigate to the "Home" dashboard to get an overview of the platform.

**Expected Output:**
- Access to the QualysGuard dashboard with a functioning account.

### Exercise 2: Configuring Scanning Assets

**Steps:**

1. In the QualysGuard dashboard, go to the "Assets" tab.
2. Click "Host Assets" and then "New" to add a new asset.
3. Enter the IP address or hostname of the target machine you want to scan.
4. Save the new asset.

**Expected Output:**
- The target machine is added as a scanning asset in QualysGuard.

### Exercise 3: Creating and Launching a Scan

**Steps:**

1. Navigate to the "Scans" tab in the QualysGuard dashboard.
2. Click "New Scan" and select "Internal Scan" or "External Scan" based on your target.
3. Fill in the scan details, such as scan name and select the target asset.
4. Configure any additional scan settings if necessary.
5. Launch the scan.

**Expected Output:**
- QualysGuard starts scanning the configured target. You can monitor the scan progress in the "Scans" tab.

### Exercise 4: Reviewing Scan Results

**Steps:**

1. Once the scan is complete, go to the "Scans" tab and click on the completed scan.
2. Review the scan summary and details, focusing on detected vulnerabilities and their severity.
3. Navigate through the different sections of the report to understand the vulnerabilities, potential impacts, and remediation suggestions.

**Expected Output:**
- A comprehensive scan report detailing vulnerabilities, their severity, and recommended remediation actions.

### Exercise 5: Creating a Remediation Plan

**Steps:**

1. Based on the scan report, identify critical vulnerabilities that need immediate attention.
2. In the QualysGuard dashboard, navigate to the "Tickets" tab.
3. Create a new remediation ticket, assigning it to the responsible team or individual.
4. Include details about the vulnerabilities, recommended fixes, and a timeline for remediation.
5. Monitor the progress of the remediation ticket and ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed.

**Expected Output:**
- A remediation ticket is created and tracked in QualysGuard, helping to manage and resolve identified vulnerabilities.

By completing these exercises, students will gain hands-on experience with QualysGuard for vulnerability management, including setting up assets, performing scans, reviewing results, and creating remediation plans.
